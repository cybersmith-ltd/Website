It secures against most common internet based cyber-attacks.</p><p>Certification to CE+ comes in two stages. First you fill in a self-assessment questionnaire (often called CE or CE basic), then an assessor tests your systems.</p><h2>What We Offer<span class=white-dot>.</span></h2><p>We are a fully accredited CE+ certification body who will walk you through the process from start to finish. We are:</p><ul><li><span class=colour-section>Specialists:</span> Unlike others vendors where CE+ is an extra they often outsource. We are testing experts, its all we do & we do everything in house.</li><li><span class=colour-section>Qualified:</span> Our testing is only done by lead assessors who hold advanced pentesting qualifications.</li><li><span class=colour-section>Partners:</span> We don't just test you. We identify problems early & find solutions to help you pass.</li></ul><p>We never promise a client they will pass. But we have a 100% CE+ client pass rate.</p><p>That's because we promise to work with you for as long as it takes to help you pass.</p><h2>Simple Fixed Pricing<span class=white-dot>.</span></h2><p>We we guarantee:</p><ul><li>Fixed prices agreed upfront</li><li>No extra fees for services like pretesting or consultancy</li><li>As much of our time as you need to pass at no extra cost</li><li>Self assessment included & charged at the cost we pay: £100s less than going direct.</li></ul><h2>Self-Assessment Included<span class=white-dot>.</span></h2><p>CE self-assessment is a required first step of CE+, but it also can be done on its own to just certify to CE.</p><p>Providers often quote CE+ without self-assessment & add it on as an extra. We find this misleading. Its not optional you need self-assessment for CE+.</p><p>If you have done self-assessment elsewhere, we can accept that & offer a discount. But because we only charge it at our cost, you'll get the best value doing it with us.</p><h2>Average Pricing<span class=white-dot>.</span></h2><p>Pricing depends on your size and complexity. But on average our clients pay (ex VAT):</p><ul><li>Micro: £1,200-£2,000 (1-9 Employees)</li><li>Small: £2,000-£2,500 (10-49 Employees)</li><li>Medium: £2,500-£3,000 (50-249 Employees)</li><li>Large: £3,000+ (250+ Employees)</li></ul><h2>Get A Quote<span class=white-dot>.</span></h2><p>Call <a href=tel:+447786003999 class=dotted-link>07786003999</a> or email <a href=mailto:info@cybersmith.co.uk class=dotted-link>info@cybersmith.co.uk</a> us for a quote.</p></main><footer><a href=/policy>Policies & Processes</a></footer></body></html>
